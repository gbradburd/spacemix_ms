finish cleaning up warbler re-writes
		
make 2 object querying functions
	-2) 2 pop names, and have the covariance vs. distance between all pairs pop out
			-esp. for warb_pops

make notes on all globetrotter results
	
read pickrell&reich

In runs where Indian and IndianJew don't find each other's admixture, 
	what happens if they do? - boutique
			
make plotting functions doc

fix SpaceMix so that admix proportions don't go 0,1 (only in the prior)
	-alpha_D -> alpha_1

move bar_inland_ad to suppmat, move big_barr_ad to main text

sims description, mij, segsite

fix spacemix so that \hat(omega)/L ~ W(\Omega,L)
	P: is it L or L-1 degrees of freedom?

meet w/ graham todo:
	-add cornerad CYOL to CYOL panel
		-shrink scenario to inset panel
	-make admix panel with
		-cornerad, bar_inland_ad, big_barr_ad
	-take out source_only cornerad fig
	-make PCA for everybody
	-empirical systems fig w/ warb next to globe map
	-take out warb nuggs*adprops
	-shrink warb map and inset?
	-CYOL figs for warb pops
	-warb PCA to suppmat





COMPLETED:

	Prioritize:
	taking bits of methods out of main text
	keep Pedro in the loop (don't need him now, but heads-up)
	make f-stats doc
	start suppmat (to get all figs in tex)
	re-work Fig4 w/ arrows
	G^(A) is where we get admixture from
	drop human CYOL to 2panel
	make CYOL 3-panel into 4 panel w/ setup
	re-color continental african pops
	get D vs. D_hat for easy groupings (suppmat)
	color sim pops by longitude
	make names of admix sources diff
		-make a gazillion pics
		-experiment w/ dots in lieu of names for non-focal pops
	main text:
		prior on admix proportions
			capped at a half
		prior on pop locations
	add bit for graham to fill in on IBD w/in diff clusters
	write human section
		-admixed pops are who we expect
			-Handwavy Indian section
	send P.D. Fields the vcf2bedassle function
	make new color scheme
		make fig mock-ups w/ new color scheme
	ditch borders on world map
	make admix map w/ africa inset
	re-jigger sim lattice figs
	intro:
	gene flow is pervasive in many species
	not well represented by discrete samples
	admixture should be defined as unusually long gene flow
	re-sim big_barr_ad_scenario w/ 40% admixture
	-take out alpha priors and just ref appendix
	-"accommodating heterogeneous processes"
	-change (*) to *
	-take out location prior math
	-1) give a pop name and have the admix arrow + source highlighted
	Inference:
		Methods section at the end:
			MCMC:
				description of each proposal mechanism
				simplifications to the likelihood (impt. speedups)
			details of procrustes (R func)
	-fix admix covariance fig
	-take out warb inferred maps across runs
	-put in good globe ad figs
	-try to procrustes CYOL eurasia to flatten out
	-try to procrustes CYOL&AD eurasia to flatten out
	-check for globe anomalies
	
AFTER SUBMISSION:
	fix spacemix to run \hat(omega)/L ~ W(\Omega,L)
	re-mean centering our standardized freq.
