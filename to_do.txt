write human section
	-admixed pops are who we expect
		-Handwavy Indian section

read pickrell&reich

add bit for graham to fill in on IBD w/in diff clusters

make names of admix sources diff
	-make a gazillion pics
	-experiment w/ dots in lieu of names for non-focal pops

main text:
	prior on admix proportions
		capped at a half
	prior on pop locations

Inference:
	Methods section at the end:
		MCMC:
			description of each proposal mechanism
			simplifications to the likelihood (impt. speedups)
			
			details of procrustes (R func)


COMPLETED:

	Prioritize:
	taking bits of methods out of main text
	keep Pedro in the loop (don't need him now, but heads-up)
	make f-stats doc
	start suppmat (to get all figs in tex)
	re-work Fig4 w/ arrows
	G^(A) is where we get admixture from
	drop human CYOL to 2panel
	make CYOL 3-panel into 4 panel w/ setup
	re-color continental african pops
	get D vs. D_hat for easy groupings (suppmat)
	color sim pops by longitude
