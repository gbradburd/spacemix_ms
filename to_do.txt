write human section
	-admixed pops are who we expect
		-Handwavy Indian section

start suppmat (to get all figs in tex)

make CYOL 3-panel into 4 panel w/ setup

color sim pops by longitude

drop human CYOL to 2panel

re-color continental african pops

read pickrell&reich

get D vs. D_hat for easy groupings (suppmat)

add bit for graham to fill in on IBD w/in diff clusters

make names of admix sources diff
	-make a gazillion pics
	-experiment w/ dots in lieu of names for non-focal pops
	
make f-stats doc

G^(A) is where we get admixture from

re-work Fig4 w/ arrows

main text:
	prior on admix proportions
		capped at a half
	prior on pop locations
	
keep Pedro in the loop (don't need him now, but heads-up)
	
Inference:
	Methods section at the end:
		MCMC:
			description of each proposal mechanism
			simplifications to the likelihood (impt. speedups)
			
			details of procrustes (R func)
			
Prioritize:
	taking bits of methods out of main text
