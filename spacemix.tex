\begin{abstract}
The patterns of genetic variation observed in modern populations are the product of a complex demographic and evolutionary history.  Genetic data can be used to illuminate that history, providing information about when and how populations have diverged, how migration connects populations, and how population sizes have fluctuated over time.  Work in this area has largely focused on estimating a population phylogeny, in which shared branch length on a tree represents shared evolutionary history between a pair of populations sampled in the modern day.  However, patterns of population differentiation are rarely tree-like, as migration and colonization will continuously re-shape patterns of relatedness between populations.  Isolation by distance (IBD), in which population differentiation increases with the distance between them, may offer a more natural null hypothesis.  Here, we present a novel analytical framework, SpaceMix, for the study of spatial genetic variation and genetic admixture, and a simple statistic to describe a population’s admixture status.

\section*{Introduction}

Population-level demographic processes leave their mark on patterns of genetic variation and differentiation within and between populations.  Recent population genetics methods have focused on ways of learning about those processes from genetic observations, including demographic inference from the allele frequency spectrum (Song) and inference of the ancestral recombination graph from orthologous sequence data (Song, Rasmussen\&Siepel).  

Further work has focused on joint inference and visualization of whole-genome patterns of relatedness, specifically on estimating a population phylogeny describing the evolutionary history shared between sampled individuals or populations (e.g. Pickrell \& Pritchard, Patterson \& Moorjani, Reich?).  The approach of modeling relatedness between populations within species as a tree-like structure was pioneered by Cavalli-Sforza (\&Thompson?) in the 1960s \gb{?}, when genetic character data (blood types) were first becoming available in humans.  

Their work has been greatly extended by Pickrell and Pritchard (2012), whose method, TreeMix, models covariance in allele frequencies across loci as a population directed acyclic graph.  TreeMix then accommodates reticulate population structure by allowing branches on the population tree tree to be connected by arrows of admixture that explain excess residual covariance between populations or population 'clades.' 

In parallel, Patterson and Reich and Moorjani and Other Folks have developed a suite of tests for genetic admixture between a set of populations assuming a tree-like structure to their evolutionary history.

%Further work has focused on joint inference and visualization approaches, which are designed to visually summarize whole genome patterns of relatedness between sampled populations or individuals while simultaneously making inference on their shared evolutionary history.  Many of these visualization approaches have been largely model-free, relying 

most of this work has focused on building population phylogenies (rich history).  in acknowledgement of prevalence of departures from tree-structure, recent work has allowed reticulations, defined as admixture, very good stuff

however, we feel a more natural framework for studying this is IBD. (prevalence in nature, rich history there too).

Here, we present an analytical framework and develop an inference algorithm for studying the spatial distribution of genetic variation based on a reasonable model of isolation by distance.  We also introduce a simple statistic for quantifying a population's admixture status, and demonstrate the utility of this approach with two high profile empirical applications.

\section*{Methods}
\subsection*{Data}
basically copy bedassle here, but include info on lat/long

%%%%%%%%% %%%%%%%%% 
\subsection*{The Normal Approximation to Drift}
If time scales are sufficiently short and the extent of drift sufficiently limited, the approximation of inter-generational binomial sampling to Brownian motion is actually pretty good (figure comparing fit of binomial sampling to fit of normal approx?).  

Therefore, shared drift can be interpreted as covariance in allele frequencies across loci.

%%%%%%%%% %%%%%%%%% 
\subsection*{Mean-centering and normalizing variance}
a natural framework for modeling this covariance is the multivariate normal distribution.

however, allele frequencies are constrained to vary between 0 and 1, and may have heterogeneous variance across loci.  therefore, we mean-center and normalize, and call the mean-centered, normalized allele frequencies X.

however, allele frequencies are constrained to vary between 0 and 1, and may have heterogeneous variance across loci.  therefore, we mean-center and normalize, and call the mean-centered, normalized allele frequencies X.

this is how we get sample mean frequencies, and this is how we get X from frequency data

note, using the sample mean frequency to mean-center can induce negative covariance, and also we lose a degree of freedom.  we discuss this further below.

%%%%%%%%% %%%%%%%%% 
\subsection*{Spatial Covariance Model}
we can model the sample covariance in mean-centered normalized allele frequencies as Wishart with degrees of freedom equal to the number of loci across which the covariance is calculated.

The form of our parametric covariance matrix fits a model of exponential decay to allele frequency covariance with geographic distance.  The covariance between populations $i$ and $j$ is 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:spatial_covariance}
\omega_{i,j} = \frac{1}{\alpha_0} \text{exp} \left(	\left( \alpha_1D_{i,j} \right)^{\alpha_2} \right)\text{,}
\end{equation}
where $D_{i,j}$ is the geographic distance between population $i$ and $j$, $\alpha_0$ controls the sill of the covariance (the within-population variance, or the covariance when distance between points is 0),  $\alpha_1$ controls the rate of the decay of covariance per unit pairwise distance, and $\alpha_2$ determines the shape of that decay.
The likelihood function is therefore XXXX.

%%%%%%%%% %%%%%%%%% 
\subsection*{Accommodating non-equilibrium processes}
This model assumes that the system is in migration-drift equilibrium and that every unit of pairwise geographic distance is equivalent in its contribution to decay of allelic covariance, but in many cases those assumptions will not be met.

Non-equilibrium processes like long distance dispersal, recent migration, colonization, or population expansion events will distort the shape of the decay of covariance with distance, and may bias parameter estimation.  Depending on the distribution and history of these events over the landscape, they may also result in heterogeneous patterns of the decay of covariance over space.  Strong barriers to dispersal on the landscape can also bias the estimation of the contribution of a unit distance to decay in covariance.

To accommodate these heterogeneous processes, we can treat population's locations on the landscape as a random variable, and estimate them as part of our inference procedure.  Two populations that are sampled at distant locations but that are genetically similar (perhaps one was recently founded by a colonization event from the other) may choose estimated locations that are nearby, while two populations that are sampled close together, but that are genetically dissimilar (e.g, the recently founded population and its neighbor), may choose locations that are farther apart.
The result is a map \gb{how do we feel about the word "geogenetic?"} in which the distances between populations are indicative of the way that populations perceive the distances between themselves.  There is a rich history of this type of data visualization, especially using reduced dimensionality representations of the data such as Principal Components Analysis (e.g. Menozzi, Piazza, and Cavalli-Sforza 1978, Novembre et al 2008, Novembre and Stephens 2008).  Our method offers an improvement over PCA-based visualization methods in that it offers an explicit model of spatial genetic variation, and can therefore be used as a robust framework for inference and hypothesis testing (see also Yang et al 2012, Yang et al 2014).

Our likelihood function is now XXXXX.   (Spatial priors?)

We can initiate from random locations to remove any influence of the observed map on the output via the prior, or we can change the variance on the spatial priors to ascertain the effect of the prior on inference.

%%%%%%%%% %%%%%%%%% 
\subsection*{Spatial Admixture Statistic}
Given a model of isolation by distance and allele frequencies sampled at different points on a map, we can calculate (1) whether a population's genetic makeup is well predicted by that of its neighbors, and (2) whether a focal population has excess covariance with another sampled population.

%%%%%%%%% %%%%%%%%% 
\subsection*{Inference of Spatial Admixture}
We can interpret this excess covariance over anomalously long distances as genetic admixture, and we can incorporate it into out inference framework.  We define the allele frequency at locus $\ell$ in admixed population $k$ to be
\begin{equation}
f_{\ell,k} = pf_{\ell,i} + (1-p)f_{\ell,j},
\end{equation}
where $f_{\ell,i}$ is the allele frequency in population $i$, $f_{\ell,j}$ is the allele frequency in population $j$, and $p$ is the admixture proportion, which varies between 0 and 1 and describes the extent to which populations $i$ and $j$ are contributing to the genetic make-up of population $k$.

To infer the spatial context of this admixture, we allow each population a point in space (\gb{can I use the phrase `ghost population,' or is that too goofy?}) from which it draws its admixture, and we model both the location of that point and the extent (proportion) of that admixture.  The observed allele frequencies in sampled populations are therefore a weighted average of the model-estimated allele frequencies at the geographic location of the sampled population and those at the coordinates from which the observed population draws admixture.  That is, the observed allele frequencies in population $k$ are modeled as follows:
\begin{equation}
f_{k} = pf_{k'} + (1-p)f_{j},
\end{equation}
where $f_{k'}$ are the model-estimated allele frequencies across loci at the spatial location of population $k$ and $f_{j}$ are the model-estimated allele frequencies at the spatial location $j$ from which population $k$ is drawing admixture in proportion $p$.  The admixture proportion $p$ is constrained to vary between 0 and 0.5, such that at least half of a population's genetic make-up must be determined by its geographic location.

The covariance between sampled populations $i$ and $j$ can be modeled as
\begin{alignat}{3}
\label{eq:admixed_covariance_1}
\Omega_{i,j} = (1-p_i)(1-p_j) \omega_{i\;,\;j\;} \; \times&\\
(p_i)(1-p_j) \omega_{i',\;j\;} \; \times   \notag&\\
(p_j)(1-p_i) \omega_{i\;,\;j'} \; \times   \notag&\\
(p_i)(p_j) \omega_{i',\;j'} \; \phantom{\times}   \notag&
\end{alignat}
where $i'$ and $j'$ are the locations from which populations $i$ and $j$ are drawing their admixture with proportions $p_i$ and $p_j$, and $\omega$ is the spatial covariance function parameterized by the pairwise geographic distances between each pair of populations.
In addition, we introduce a population-specific variance term on each diagonal element of the covariance matrix.  This term accommodates both the binomial sampling noise introduced by finite chromosome sample size in each population and also population-specific drift.  The full expression for our admixed covariance function is below.
\begin{alignat}{3}
\label{eq:admixed_covariance_2}
\Omega_{i,j} = (1-p_i)(1-p_j) \omega_{i\;,\;j\;} \; \times&\\
(p_i)(1-p_j) \omega_{i',\;j\;} \; \times   \notag&\\
(p_j)(1-p_i) \omega_{i\;,\;j'} \; \times   \notag&\\
(p_i)(p_j) \omega_{i',\;j'} \; +   \notag&\\
I\bar{S_k}^{-1} + \eta_k \phantom{+} \notag&
\end{alignat}

where $I$ is the identity matrix, $\bar{S_k}$ is the mean sample size in population $k$ across all loci, and $\eta_k$ is the nugget estimated in population $k$.

The locations of the set of $k$ points from which the $k$ sampled populations draw admixture, and the vector of length $k$ of each population's admixture proportion, $p_k$, are treated as random variables and jointly estimated as part of our inference procedure.

The likelihood function for this model in which each population is allowed to draw admixture from a point in space is therefore XXXX.

\subsection*{Models}
The models described above may be used in various combinations.  In the simplest model, populations may not choose their own locations, nor are they allowed to draw admixture, and the only parameters to be estimated are those of the spatial covariance function given in Eqn \eqref{eq:spatial_covariance}, and the population-specific variance terms ($\eta_k$).  In the most complex model, population locations, the locations of their sources of admixture, and the proportions of that admixture are all estimated jointly in addition to the parameters of the spatial covariance function and the population specific variances.  %The other combinations involve keeping population locations fixed, but allowing them to draw admixture, and allowing populations to move, but not allowing them to draw admixture.

To demonstrate the applications of this novel method, we employed it in two canonical empirical systems: the greenish warbler ring species complex, and, to our knowledge, the most complete geographic sampling of human populations to date (\gb{is this true?}).
