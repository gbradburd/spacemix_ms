	abstract = {Understanding the genetic structure of human populations is of fundamental interest to medical, forensic and anthropological sciences. Advances in high-throughput genotyping technology have markedly improved our understanding of global patterns of human genetic variation and suggest the potential to use large samples to uncover variation among closely spaced populations–. Here we characterize genetic variation in a sample of 3,000 European individuals genotyped at over half a million variable {DNA} sites in the human genome. Despite low average levels of genetic differentiation among Europeans, we find a close correspondence between genetic and geographic distances; indeed, a geographical map of Europe arises naturally as an efficient two-dimensional summary of genetic variation in Europeans. The results emphasize that when mapping the genetic basis of a disease phenotype, spurious associations can arise if genetic structure is not properly accounted for. In addition, the results are relevant to the prospects of genetic ancestry testing; an individual’s {DNA} can be used to infer their geographic origin with surprising accuracy—often to within a few hundred kilometres.},

	abstract = {Nearly thirty years ago, Cavalli-Sforza et al pioneered the use of principal components analysis ({PCA}) to summarise data on variation in human gene frequencies across continental regions []. Cavalli-Sforza et al produced maps representing each Principal Component ({PC}), and found these maps exhibited highly distinctive patterns, including gradients and sinusoidal waves. They interpreted these patterns as resulting from specific migration events, such as the migration of agriculturalists out of the Near East [, , ]. Cavalli-Sforza et al’s results have been highly influential (e.g. []), and controversial [, , , , ], and {PCA} has become heavily used in population genetics (e.g. [, , , ]). Despite its widespread use, the behavior of {PCA} with data exhibiting continuous spatial variation, such as might exist within human continental groups, has been little studied. Here, using empirical and theoretical approaches, we find that the distinctive patterns observed by Cavalli-Sforza et al resemble sinusoidal mathematical artifacts that arise generally when {PCA} is applied to spatial data, implying that the patterns are not necessarily due to population movements. Our results aid the interpretation of {PCA} results from large-scale analyses of human genetic variation, and suggest that {PCA} will be helpful in correcting for continuous population structure in association studies.},

To illustrate the methods, we give a number of examples that provide new insights about the history of human admixture. The most striking finding is a clear signal of admixture into northern Europe, with one ancestral population related to present-day Basques and Sardinians and the other related to present-day populations of northeast Asia and the Americas. This likely reflects a history of admixture between Neolithic migrants and the indigenous Mesolithic population of Europe, consistent with recent analyses of ancient bones from Sweden and the sequencing of the genome of the Tyrolean “Iceman.”},

	abstract = {Admixture between genetically different populations may produce gametic association between gene loci as a function of the genetic difference between parental populations and the admixture rate. This association decays as a function of time since admixture and the recombination rate between the loci. Admixture between genetically long-separated human populations has been frequent in the centuries since the age of exploration and colonization, resulting in numerous hybrid descendant populations today, as in the Americas. This represents a natural experiment for genetic epidemiology and anthropology, in which to use polymorphic marker loci (e.g., restriction fragment length polymorphisms) and disequilibrium to infer a genetic basis for traits of interest. In this paper we show that substantial disequilibrium remains today under widely applicable situations, which can be detected without requiring inordinately close linkage between trait and marker loci. Very disparate parental allele frequencies produce large disequilibrium, but the sample size needed to detect such levels of disequilibrium can be large due to the skewed haplotype frequency distribution in the admixed population. Such situations, however, provide power to differentiate between disequilibrium due just to population mixing from that due to physical linkage of loci--i.e., to help map the genetic locus of the trait. A gradient of admixture levels between the same parental populations may be used to test genetic models by relating admixture to disequilibrium levels.},

It is still a challenge, however, to infer reliable parameter values for complicated models involving many populations. Here, we present {MixMapper}, an efficient, interactive method for constructing phylogenetic trees including admixture events using single nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP}) genotype data. {MixMapper} implements a novel two-phase approach to admixture inference using moment statistics, first building an unadmixed scaffold tree and then adding admixed populations by solving systems of equations that express allele frequency divergences in terms of mixture parameters. Importantly, all features of the model, including topology, sources of gene flow, branch lengths, and mixture proportions, are optimized automatically from the data and include estimates of statistical uncertainty. {MixMapper} also uses a new method to express branch lengths in easily interpretable drift units. We apply {MixMapper} to recently published data for Human Genome Diversity Cell Line Panel individuals genotyped on a {SNP} array designed especially for use in population genetics studies, obtaining confident results for 30 populations, 20 of them admixed. Notably, we confirm a signal of ancient admixture in European populations—including previously undetected admixture in Sardinians and Basques—involving a proportion of 20–40\% ancient northern Eurasian ancestry.},

We report genome-wide data from 73 groups from the Indian subcontinent and analyze linkage disequilibrium to estimate {ANI}-{ASI} mixture dates ranging from about 1,900 to 4,200 years ago. In a subset of groups, 100\% of the mixture is consistent with having occurred during this period.

Both {HGDP}-{UG} and {PanAsia}-{UG} showed a substantial admixture of East-Asian ({EAS}) and European ({EUR}) ancestries, with an empirical estimation of ancestry contribution of 53:47 ({EAS}:{EUR}) and 48:52 for {HGDP}-{UG} and {PanAsia}-{UG}, respectively. The effective admixture time under a model with a single pulse of admixture was estimated as 110 generations and 129 generations, or admixture events occurred about 2200 and 2580 years ago for {HGDP}-{UG} and {PanAsia}-{UG}, respectively, assuming an average of 20 yr per generation. Despite Uyghurs' earlier history compared to other admixture populations, admixture mapping, holds promise for this population, because of its large size and its mixture of ancestry from different continents. We screened multiple databases and identified a genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism panel that can distinguish {EAS} and {EUR} ancestry of chromosomal segments in Uyghurs. The panel contains 8150 ancestry-informative markers ({AIMs}) showing large frequency differences between {EAS} and {EUR} populations ({FST} \&gt; 0.25, mean {FST} = 0.43) but small frequency differences (7999 {AIMs} validated) within both populations ({FST} \&lt; 0.05, mean {FST} \&lt; 0.01). We evaluated the effectiveness of this admixture map for localizing disease genes in two Uyghur populations. To our knowledge, our map constitutes the first practical resource for admixture mapping in Uyghurs, and it will enable studies of diseases showing differences in genetic risk between {EUR} and {EAS} populations.},

	abstract = {Author Summary The Horn of Africa ({HOA}) occupies a central place in our understanding of modern human origins. This region is the location of the earliest known modern human fossils, a possible source for the out-of-Africa migration, and one of the most genetically and linguistically diverse regions of the world. Numerous genetic studies over the last decades have identified substantial non-African ancestry in populations in this region. Because there is archaeological, historical, and linguistic evidence for contact with non-African populations beginning about 3,000 years ago, it has often been assumed that the non-African ancestry in {HOA} populations dates to this time. In this work, we find that the genetic composition of non-African ancestry in the {HOA} is distinct from the genetic composition of current populations in North Africa and the Middle East. With these data, we demonstrate that most non-African ancestry in the {HOA} cannot be the result of admixture within the last few thousand years, and that the majority of admixture probably occurred prior to the advent of agriculture. These results contribute to a growing body of work showing that prehistoric hunter-gatherer populations were much more dynamic than usually assumed.},

By introducing methods that can estimate ancestry without accurate ancestral populations, we show that {ANI} ancestry ranges from 39-71\% in most Indian groups, and is higher in traditionally upper caste and Indo-European speakers. Groups with only {ASI} ancestry may no longer exist in mainland India. However, the indigenous Andaman Islanders are unique in being {ASI}-related groups without {ANI} ancestry. Allele frequency differences between groups in India are larger than in Europe, reflecting strong founder effects whose signatures have been maintained for thousands of years owing to endogamy.

Southern Europeans and Middle Eastern populations are known to have inherited a small percentage of their genetic material from recent sub-Saharan African migrations, but there has been no estimate of the exact proportion of this gene flow, or of its date. Here, we apply genomic methods to show that the proportion of African ancestry in many Southern European groups is 1\%–3\%, in Middle Eastern groups is 4\%–15\%, and in Jewish groups is 3\%–5\%. To estimate the dates when the mixture occurred, we develop a novel method that estimates the size of chromosomal segments of distinct ancestry in individuals of mixed ancestry. We verify using computer simulations that the method produces useful estimates of population mixture dates up to 300 generations in the past. By applying the method to West Eurasians, we show that the dates in Southern Europeans are consistent with events during the Roman Empire and subsequent Arab migrations. The dates in the Jewish groups are older, consistent with events in classical or biblical times that may have occurred in the shared history of Jewish populations.},

Historical records, archaeology, and mitochondrial and Y-chromosome {DNA} have been marshaled in support of one theory or another, but there is little consensus regarding the overall genetic background of North African populations or their origin and expansion. We characterize the patterns of genetic variation in North Africa using ∼730,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms from across the genome for seven populations. We observe two distinct, opposite gradients of ancestry: an east-to-west increase in likely autochthonous North African ancestry and an east-to-west decrease in likely Near Eastern Arabic ancestry. The indigenous North African ancestry may have been more common in Berber populations and appears most closely related to populations outside of Africa, but divergence between Maghrebi peoples and Near Eastern/Europeans likely precedes the Holocene ({\textgreater}12,000 ya). We also find significant signatures of sub-Saharan African ancestry that vary substantially among populations. These sub-Saharan ancestries appear to be a recent introduction into North African populations, dating to about 1,200 years ago in southern Morocco and about 750 years ago into Egypt, possibly reflecting the patterns of the trans-Saharan slave trade that occurred during this period.},

Recent work has introduced explicit models for the geographic distribution of genetic variation and has shown that such explicit models yield superior accuracy in ancestry inference over nonmodel-based methods. Here we extend such work to introduce a method that models admixture between ancestors from multiple sources across a geographic continuum. We devise efficient algorithms based on hidden Markov models to localize on a map the recent ancestors (e.g., grandparents) of admixed individuals, joint with assigning ancestry at each locus in the genome. We validate our methods by using empirical data from individuals with mixed European ancestry from the Population Reference Sample study and show that our approach is able to localize their recent ancestors within an average of 470 km of the reported locations of their grandparents. Furthermore, simulations from real Population Reference Sample genotype data show that our method attains high accuracy in localizing recent ancestors of admixed individuals in Europe (an average of 550 km from their true location for localization of two ancestries in Europe, four generations ago). We explore the limits of ancestry localization under our approach and find that performance decreases as the number of distinct ancestries and generations since admixture increases. Finally, we build a map of expected localization accuracy across admixed individuals according to the location of origin within Europe of their ancestors.},

The gradient of North African ancestry accounts for previous observations of low levels of sharing with Sub-Saharan Africa and is independent of recent gene flow from the Near East.

Genetic variation in natural populations typically demonstrates structure arising from diverse processes including geographical isolation, founder events, migration, and admixture. One technique commonly used to uncover such structure is principal components analysis, which identifies the primary axes of variation in data and projects the samples onto these axes in a graphically appealing and intuitive manner. However, as the method is non-parametric, it can be hard to relate {PCA} to underlying process. Here, I show that the underlying genealogical history of the samples can be related directly to the {PC} projection. The result is useful because it is straightforward to predict the effects of different demographic processes on the sample genealogy. However, the result also reveals the limitations of {PCA}, in that multiple processes can give the same projections, it is strongly influenced by uneven sampling, and it discards important information in the spatial structure of genetic variation along chromosomes.},

<p>The demographic history of our species is reflected in patterns of genetic variation within and among populations. We developed an efficient method for calculating the expected distribution of genetic variation, given a demographic model including such events as population size changes, population splits and joins, and migration. We applied our approach to publicly available human sequencing data, searching for models that best reproduce the observed patterns. Our joint analysis of data from African, European, and Asian populations yielded new dates for when these populations diverged. In particular, we found that African and Eurasian populations diverged around 100,000 years ago. This is earlier than other genetic studies suggest, because our model includes the effects of migration, which we found to be important for reproducing observed patterns of variation in the data. We also analyzed data from European, Asian, and Mexican populations to model the peopling of the Americas. Here, we find no evidence for recurrent migration after East Asian and Native American populations diverged. Our methods are not limited to studying humans, and we hope that future sequencing projects will offer more insights into the history of both our own species and others.</p>

species can gradually evolve into two, but are rare in nature 1--3 . In
the greenish warbler (Phylloscopus trochiloides) species complex, a
ring of populations wraps around Tibet. Two reproductively isolated
forms co-exist in central Siberia, with a gradient of genetic and pheno-
typic characteristics through the southern chain of populations con-
necting them 4–6 . Previous genetic evidence has proven inconclusive,
however, regarding whether species divergence took place in the face
of continuous gene flow and whether hybridization between the ter-
minal forms of the ring ever occurred 7–9 . Here we use genome-wide
analyses to show that, although spatial patterns of genetic variation are
currently mostly as expected of a ring species, historical breaks in gene
flow have existed at more than one location around the ring, and the
two Siberian forms have occasionally interbred. Substantial periods of
geographicalisolationoccurrednotonlyinthenorthbutalsointhewestern
Himalayas, where there is now an extensive hybrid zone between gen-
etically divergent forms. Limited asymmetric introgression has occurred
directly between the Siberian forms, although it has not caused a blend-
ing of those forms, suggesting selection against introgressed genes in the
novel genetic background. Levels of reproductive isolation and genetic
introgression are consistent with levels of phenotypic divergence around
the ring, with phenotypic similarity and extensive interbreeding across
the southwestern contact zone and strong phenotypic divergence and
nearly complete reproductive isolation across the northern contact zone.
These results cast doubt on the hypothesis that the greenish warbler
should be viewed as a rare example of speciation by distance 6 , but
demonstrate that the greenish warbler displays a continuum from
slightly divergent neighbouring populations to almost fully repro-
ductively isolated species.},
