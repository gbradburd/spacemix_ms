<p>The demographic history of our species is reflected in patterns of genetic variation within and among populations. We developed an efficient method for calculating the expected distribution of genetic variation, given a demographic model including such events as population size changes, population splits and joins, and migration. We applied our approach to publicly available human sequencing data, searching for models that best reproduce the observed patterns. Our joint analysis of data from African, European, and Asian populations yielded new dates for when these populations diverged. In particular, we found that African and Eurasian populations diverged around 100,000 years ago. This is earlier than other genetic studies suggest, because our model includes the effects of migration, which we found to be important for reproducing observed patterns of variation in the data. We also analyzed data from European, Asian, and Mexican populations to model the peopling of the Americas. Here, we find no evidence for recurrent migration after East Asian and Native American populations diverged. Our methods are not limited to studying humans, and we hope that future sequencing projects will offer more insights into the history of both our own species and others.</p>

  abstract = {Ring species provide particularly clear demonstrations of how one
species can gradually evolve into two, but are rare in nature 1--3 . In
the greenish warbler (Phylloscopus trochiloides) species complex, a
ring of populations wraps around Tibet. Two reproductively isolated
forms co-exist in central Siberia, with a gradient of genetic and pheno-
typic characteristics through the southern chain of populations con-
necting them 4–6 . Previous genetic evidence has proven inconclusive,
however, regarding whether species divergence took place in the face
of continuous gene flow and whether hybridization between the ter-
minal forms of the ring ever occurred 7–9 . Here we use genome-wide
analyses to show that, although spatial patterns of genetic variation are
currently mostly as expected of a ring species, historical breaks in gene
flow have existed at more than one location around the ring, and the
two Siberian forms have occasionally interbred. Substantial periods of
geographicalisolationoccurrednotonlyinthenorthbutalsointhewestern
Himalayas, where there is now an extensive hybrid zone between gen-
etically divergent forms. Limited asymmetric introgression has occurred
directly between the Siberian forms, although it has not caused a blend-
ing of those forms, suggesting selection against introgressed genes in the
novel genetic background. Levels of reproductive isolation and genetic
introgression are consistent with levels of phenotypic divergence around
the ring, with phenotypic similarity and extensive interbreeding across
the southwestern contact zone and strong phenotypic divergence and
nearly complete reproductive isolation across the northern contact zone.
These results cast doubt on the hypothesis that the greenish warbler
should be viewed as a rare example of speciation by distance 6 , but
demonstrate that the greenish warbler displays a continuum from
slightly divergent neighbouring populations to almost fully repro-
ductively isolated species.},
